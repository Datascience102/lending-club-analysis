Business Problem: Assessing credit worthiness of customers in Lending Club and their probability of defaulting.

Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data

### 1.Introduction to the Business Problem

Lending Club is the worldâ€™s largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors.They operate at a lower cost than traditional bank lending programs and pass the savings on to borrowers in the form of lower rates and to investors in the form of solid returns.

THis project aims to analyse Lending Club's issued loans over 9 year period (2007-2015) and zdentify early indicators that could predict a customer's probability of defaulting. The insight obtained could help to drive differentiated credit approval process for different customer segment (e.g faster approval time, minimal security for low risk customers)

### 2.Process to solve the Business Problem

We would suggest the following process
1. Understand Lending Club Business Model & Data Set
2. Clean the data, identify relevant attributes/columns & separate training and testing dataset
3. Generate Hypothesis 
4. Apply Dimensionality Reduction on Hypothesis
5. Apply Segmentation & Classification Tree on Training Dataset
6. Apply Algorithm on Testing Dataset (Iterate if required)
7. Capture insights & Summarise
